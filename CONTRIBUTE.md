**Sections**: put the link under the section you think it should be in. Feel free to add new section.

- Write-up: posts talk about failures and how to deal with, e.g: blog, medium, hackernews,...

- Talk: video/streaming, e.g: KubeCon, DockerCon,... (you can add brief key points of the talk)

- Incident/Outage: incidents/outages/post mortem when running Kubernetes.


**Format**:

Links should follow the format (inspired by https://github.com/icy/w2w):

```
- Year - Company/Team - Title/Summary (or whatever you think it's worth to mention) - The link
```

It's good if you use official links, publish time ordered and meaningful messages in commit.


Thanks!
